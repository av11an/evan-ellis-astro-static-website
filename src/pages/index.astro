			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my personal website where I get a chance to share
				a little bit about myself.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently a Support Engineer at AWS. Trying to work my way up
				on becoming a Software Developer Engineer. I live in Washington,
				love to play Tennis in the Spring/Summer and then play Hockey in 
				the Fall/Winter. I also recently started riding motorcycles! Below
				is a picture of my YZF-R3.

				Be sure to check out my blog where I talk about topics I am
				interested in or about projects I am currently working on.
